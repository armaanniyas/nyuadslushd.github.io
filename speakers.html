                <p>Ayoola is an Engineer and social entrepreneur. He co-founded Cycled Technologies in 2016 to deliver waste management products and services that help buildings and municipalities recycle more and reduce logistics expenses. Since then, he has led operations at the company and championed the development of the Cycled Self Sorting SmartBin Technology which earned him an “MIT Technology Reviews Innovator Under 35” recognition. Ayoola also holds a PhD in Mechanical Engineering and by virtue of his scientific exploits, he was involved in the development of the Non-contact Multiphysics Probe, which is a groundbreaking addition to the toolkit of the Human Atlas Project -- the world's most ambitious genetic research project. Prior to co-founding Cycled Technologies, Ayoola served as the Executive Director of Nordoest which was the Middle East’s Representative of Innovation Norway — the Norwegian Government’s most important instrument for innovation and development of Norwegian enterprises. He also served as the Technical Director of Nordic Innovation Hub — a cleantech incubator in Masdar City Abu Dhabi, set up as a collaboration between the five Nordic countries and supported by Nordic Innovation. Ayoola will be speaking in the founder panel about passion and mission building through his venture.
